					<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Manually translating <em>prescriptive</em> rules into computer code</li>
						<li>Publishing this translation, so computer systems can use it</li>
						<li>Testing our interpretation of the rules with clear, reproducible test data</li>
					</ul>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Why Code The Rules?</h3>
						<p>Every computer system that interacts with rules, codes them</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Lets do it once</h3>
						<p>So that everyone uses the same rules</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Often the interaction between rules is incomprehensible to mere humans...</p>

						<h3>Let's do rules better</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>By explaining our rules to a stupid computer, we can help ensure they make sense</li>
							<li>Rules and computer systems become easier to integrate with, test, and modify</li>
							<li>By reducing the burden of legislation, we improve our customer's experience</li>

						<h3>Let's use the example of the Energy Savings Scheme to explain how this process works.</h3>
					</section>
										<section>
					<h3>What is the Energy Savings Scheme?<br></h3>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">In a sentence, the Energy Savings Scheme (Scheme) provides financial incentives to create energy savings, through conducting energy savings activities.</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">The aim of the Scheme is to encourage investment in energy efficiency, lower energy usage and lower energy costs, across households, business and industry.</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">The Scheme is coordinated by DPIE and administered by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART), who sit within DCS. </span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>A simplified flow of how the Scheme works<br></h3>
					<img width="90%" alt="Down arrow" data-lazy-loaded="" data-src="img/ess_process_flow.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Success of the Scheme to date<br></h3>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.75em">Since the beginning of the Scheme in July 2009, it has achieved:</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em"><b>28,000 GWh</b> of energy savings (through to 2028)</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em"><b>$6.2 billion</b> in energy bill savings (through to 2028)</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em"><b>29 million</b> Energy Savings Certificates (since 2009)</span></p>

					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>The ESS and Rules<br></h3>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.75em">The activities eligible for ESS incentives are defined within the Energy Savings Scheme Rule (ESS Rule).</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.75em">DPIE updates the Rule approximately yearly, to continue incentivising better than best practice.</span></p>

					<h3>The future of the ESS<br></h3>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: centre; font-size:0.75em">The Energy Security Safeguard (Safeguard) was announced in late 2019, with two major components:</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">An expansion of the existing efficiency Scheme, with increased energy savings targets</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">The introduction of a new demand reduction scheme, with a new Rule for incentivising demand reduction activities</span></p>
					<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.3em"><a href="https://energy.nsw.gov.au/media/1921/download" target="_blank">Read more about the Safeguard in the NSW Electricity Strategy.</a></span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>In summary<br></h3>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: centre; font-size:0.50em">The Scheme incentivises energy savings activities which improve energy efficiency</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">It makes significant contributions to NSW's energy savings targets</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">There's a lengthy, complex Rule which defines what's eligible for incentives</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">The new Safeguard is going to expand the scope of the Scheme</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">Continuing current Scheme delivery makes it difficult for us to achieve our new targets - which means we need to make it easier to access the Scheme</span></p>
					<p style="test-align:left;"><span style="position: left; font-size:0.50em">Reducing the complexity involved with the Rules, and enabling digital delivery of the Rules eases access to the Scheme!</span></p>

						<h3>What we've done so far is...</h3>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Worked with DCS to learn how to build a Rules as Code coding environment.</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Coded the NABERS method of the Rule (for Offices and Apartments).</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Built test cases for the use of this method.</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Reviewed the code with Legal.</p>						
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Started the process of building a proof of concept webform.</p>			
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Started planning the next sections of the ESS to code.</p>			
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>A simple example of the value of our current work.</h3>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">There's a term "Counted Energy Savings" in the NABERS method of the ESS.</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">It appears twice - and it's defined slightly differently both times it appears.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p> The difference in meanings is summarised below.<p>
					<img width="80%" alt="Down arrow" data-lazy-loaded="" data-src="img/counted_energy_ savings_definitions.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>Strictly following the existing definitions of Counted Energy Savings within the Rule, it would be impossible to calculate ESCs within NABERS because of this ambiguity - the machine would be unsure of what definition to use at this point of the calculation, and refuse to finish it.<p>

					<h3>What's so special about months?</h3>
					<p>A month is a common concept that appears everywhere.</p>
					<p>It appears in the ESS a few times, such as in 8.8.8:</p>
						<img width="100%" alt="Down arrow" data-lazy-loaded="" data-src="img/section_8_8_8.png">
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>But what exactly <em>is</em> a month?</p>
					<p>Let's see what the law says.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background-iframe="https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1987/15/part2/sec21" data-background-interactive>
						<div style="position: absolute; width: 20%; left: 0; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5), 0 5px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); color: #fff; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
						<p>This is the definition of months in the Interpretations Act.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> The legal interpretation of this definition. </h3>
						<p> So for (a), <p>
						<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.5em">a month begins on 12:00:01am on 15 July, and ends on 11:59:59pm on 14 August. Next month begins at 12:00:01am on 15 August, etc.</p>
						<p> For (b), <p>
						<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.5em">a month begins on 12:00:01am on 31 August, and ends on 11:59:59pm on 30 September. Next month begins at 12:00:01am on 1 October, ends 11:59:59pm on 31 October, etc.</p>
						<p> This functionality is difficult to replicate in code.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> What we did with this information. </h3>
						<p> We built a function to replicate this definition.</p>
						<p> There's an interesting finding we found, in codifying the strict legal interpretation of a common term and applying test cases to it. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p> Here's a test case that looks at 8.8.8, specifically at leap years.<p>

						<h3> The immediate value here is making the rule stronger, through removing ambiguity, finding loopholes and then building a rule development process around Rules as Code.</h3>

					<h3>Better Rules</h3>
					<p>Because we've got increasing targets, a second new Rule coming into effect and significant existing complexity which could scale into unworkable complexity, we're integrating Rules as Code into our rule development processes.</p>
					<p>The Better Rules framework provides a template for how we can do rule changes</p>
					<p><em>and</em></p>
					<p>Coding the rules will transform how the rules operate and are implemented.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>The current rule change process is very linear.</h3>
					<p>Here's a simplified version of the current process.</p>

					<h4>The end goal is to use an integrated Better Rules approach to build a better end product.</h4>
						<img width="85%" alt="Down arrow" data-lazy-loaded="" data-src="img/better_rules_process.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>There's three keys to building Better Rules for the ESS:</h3>
						<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.6em">- integrating the perspectives and knowledge of <strong><em>different</em></strong> experts, such as legal experts, subject matter experts and digital specialists</p>
						<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.6em">- engaging in a process of continuous iteration - prototyping Better Rules approaches and learning from development</p>
						<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.6em">- designing rules with digital service delivery, and strong outcomes for the user in mind</p>
